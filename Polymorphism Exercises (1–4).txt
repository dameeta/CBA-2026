Polymorphism Exercises (1–4)
Exercise 1: Payment System (Method Overriding)

Concept: Runtime Polymorphism

Problem Statement:
Create a base class Payment with a method pay(amount).
Create subclasses:

CreditCardPayment

UPIPayment

CashPayment

Each subclass should implement its own version of the pay() method.

Task:

Store different payment objects in a list

Call pay(1000) using a loop

Expected Learning:
Same method call → different behavior

Exercise 2: Notification System

Concept: Polymorphism with same method name

Problem Statement:
Create a class Notification with a method send(message).
Implement subclasses:

EmailNotification

SMSNotification

PushNotification

Each class should display how the message is sent.

Task:
Write a function notify_user(notification) that accepts any notification object and calls send().

Exercise 3: Shape Area Calculator

Concept: Polymorphism using method overriding

Problem Statement:
Create a base class Shape with method area().

Subclasses:

Rectangle

Circle

Triangle

Each class calculates area differently.

Task:
Store all shape objects in a list and print their areas using one loop.

Exercise 4: Employee Salary Calculation

Concept: Polymorphism in business logic

Problem Statement:
Create a base class Employee with method calculate_salary().

Subclasses:

FullTimeEmployee

PartTimeEmployee

Intern

Each employee type has different salary rules.

 Abstraction Exercises (5–7)
Exercise 5: Vehicle System

Concept: Abstract Base Class

Problem Statement:
Create an abstract class Vehicle with:

abstract method start_engine()

abstract method fuel_type()

Create subclasses:

Car

Bike

ElectricScooter

Task:
Implement all abstract methods and call them via base class reference.

Exercise 6: Banking System

Concept: Abstraction + Polymorphism

Problem Statement:
Create an abstract class BankAccount with:

deposit(amount)

abstract method calculate_interest()

Subclasses:

SavingsAccount

CurrentAccount

Each subclass calculates interest differently.

Exercise 7: Online Order Processing

Concept: Real-world abstraction

Problem Statement:
Create an abstract class Order with:

abstract method process_order()

concrete method order_summary()

Subclasses:

FoodOrder

GroceryOrder

MedicineOrder

Each order has its own processing logic.
